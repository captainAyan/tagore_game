	"Gardener: Hello sir, how are you doing in this uneventful morning.",
	"Tagore: (Aside) Should I tell him about the fact that I may have been robbed? ",
	"Tagore: (Aside) I don't know. Maybe later.",
	"Tagore: Yes, I'm doing well.",
	"Tagore: You live on this premises, don’t you?",
	"Gardener: Oh my! That must be it.",
	"Gardener: I thought that it was only me who heard commotion coming from upstairs last night.",
	"Gardener: But I was too tired to go and check what it was.",
	"Gardener: Well I wasn’t very keen on going there either, ",
	"Gardener: as you know that the rooms on the 3rd floor are empty now, as the occupants are out on vacation.",
	"Gardener: Where did they go on vacation again...!! Oh! I can't remember, do you remember sir?",
	"Tagore: Yes, I do!! Can you tell me more about the sound that you heard?",
	"Gardener: Oh yes, Haha! pardon me for digressing, it is an old habit of mine you see.",
	"Gardener: Now, What were you saying, oh yes! The sound.",
	"Gardener: It sounded like someone was ruffling through stuff. It could’ve been a cat too…",
	"Gardener: nay it can’t be a cat, the footsteps were definitely louder than that of a cat’s.",
	"Gardener: It kinda creeped me out, not gonna lie, couldn’t sleep for a while, I’m still a tad tired.",
	"Gardener: Perhaps I should go and check now, you know, while the sun is still up.",
	"Tagore: (Aside) Oh, no! I don’t want the potential “crime scene” to be tampered with.",
	"Tagore: Oh don’t be bothered, I was going to do that anyway. And you should take a nap now, if you want to.",
	"Gardener: That is so generous sir, but I have a lot of chores to finish.",
	"Tagore: (Aside) Alright, let’s give our upstairs a visit.",
